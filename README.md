## How Does All of This Work?
![next-opportunity layout](./next-opportunity-layout.jpg)


The `next-opportunity-generation-pipeline` service basically looks for pre-defined opportunities off of the web and aggregates them. Then, these opportunities are sent to the `next-opportunity-server` where it is properly stored. This data are stored in Postgres database and `next-opportunity-migrations` service handles the creation of the necessary tables. Finally, the output of all of these services can be viewed in [http://localhost:3000/opportunities](http://localhost:3000/opportunities) locally.
